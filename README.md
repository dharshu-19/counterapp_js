SIMPLE COUNTER APP USING JAVASCRIPT


This counter app is very simple because it is made using JavaScript. People's entries are added and it is easy to use. For beginners who are 
interested in learning, they can do this type of project to improve their skills in JavaScript. Additionally, I used simple Bootstrap to add 
style to the content

Outlook of this simple project:
